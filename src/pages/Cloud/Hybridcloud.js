                          <h2 className='hybmt'>Why Hybrid Cloud?</h2>
                          <h4>Public, Private, and Hybrid Clouds</h4>
                          <p>
                            Public cloud is what people think of when they hear
                            the word “cloud.” It’s ideal for application
                            development, scientific data processing, and
                            web-scale applications. On the downside, SLAs can be
                            weak and security can be limited. Exclusive use of
                            the public cloud becomes less economically feasible
                            as usage scales. Once applications hit a certain
                            usage/cost threshold, or have strict requirements,
                            such as security or data protec¬tion, that cannot be
                            met by the public cloud, organizations often
                            consider a private cloud. IT favors the private
                            cloud for core enterprise security; applications run
                            on infrastructure that is solely assigned to your
                            company and that facilitates auditing and
                            compliance. The reality is that most organizations
                            will need a blend of these options for different
                            purposes. This is referred to as a hybrid cloud. It
                            allows organizations to use the public cloud where
                            it makes sense, to create private clouds to sup¬port
                            certain application types, and to use advanced
                            techniques such as cloud hubbing—situating critical
                            hardware in network data centers in close proximity
                            to telecom providers, content distribution networks,
                            and application component providers—to place their
                            applications optimally to ensure rapid response
                            time. Hybrid cloud automates and modernizes the
                            applications estate, places workloads in their
                            optimal location, embeds security, enables an IT
                            brokerage model and creates a simple, agile,
                            on-demand environment. Hybrid Cloud also lays the
                            foundation for embracing new technologies such as
                            containerization , serverless, platform as a service
                            (PaaS), IoT and edge computing — all with an eye
                            toward improving business outcomes.

                            and directly connecting with relevant networks helps
                            to ensure an optimal end-user experience.

                          Ultimately, a hybrid IT environment enables a whole
                          new style of execution characterized by collaborative
                          development environments, consumer-controlled
                          personalized experiences, a cloud-first strategy, and
                          data-driven decisions arrived at with the help of
                          machine learning & AI.
                          <br /> <br /> For example, in a manufacturing
                          scenario, data from IoT sensors monitoring the
                          performance of machines on the factory floor can be
                          ingested using an edge computing infrastructure. Data
                          analytics is first performed locally; then the data is
                          transferred to a data lake in a cloud environment
                          where advanced analytics, AI and machine learning are
                          applied to larger data sets to gain critical insights.
                          These insights can be used to automatically initiate
                          actions in production & supply chain systems that
                          execute in a traditional infrastructure environment.
                          The hybrid IT components are managed in an integrated
                          fashion to deliver the end-to-end business processes.
                          <br /> <br /> As these examples demonstrate, the
                          potential benefits of hybrid IT are compelling, yet
                          there are notable challenges facing CIOs as they work
                          to embrace or accelerate hybrid cloud.

                      <h3>Hybrid Cloud Challenges</h3>
                      <p>
                        Migration of workloads and integration between the
                        private and public clouds are primary challenges.
                        Ensuring that applications and data do not become
                        fragmented between clouds is a key issue as well. The
                        challenge is how to accelerate the pace of change by
                        stitching together legacy environments — which aren’t
                        going away anytime soon for a variety of business,
                        security, compliance or technical reasons — with
                        emerging capabilities, creating a seamless hybrid IT
                        environment. Some of the key challenges are:

                        <p>
                          From being able to migrate between clouds to
                          supporting local data regulations, hybrid cloud
                          enables the advanced level of management of computing
                          resources that is necessary to gain competitive
                          advantage in today’s business climate. However, simple
                          migration isn’t enough. It takes the ability to
                          seamlessly manage and move workloads and jobs between
                          clouds that provides the next level. Some of the
                          entry-level use cases for a hybrid cloud include:

                          <p>
                            Backup and disaster recovery is the most common use
                            case as it serves two primary benefits. First, it
                            allows you to use a non-production workload as a
                            proof-of-concept for your initial entr into a cloud
                            environment. Second, it allows you to create
                            immediate value for your organization by elevating
                            and testing your business continuity strategy.

                          <h4>Application Development and Testing</h4>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                          Application development and testing or “DevTest” is
                          another popular use case, particularly in
                          organizations focused on innovation. Many customers
                          move their dev/test environments to the cloud to gain
                          access to elastic and on-demand IT resources, while
                          leaving their production application and database on
                          premises.
                        </p>
                      </div>
                      <div>

                          <h4>Web Servers</h4>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                          Third, customers move web servers to the cloud to take
                          advantage of elastic compute resources. This allows a
                          customer to leverage auto-scaling to right-size
                          compute resources as demand spikes or declines.
                          Organizations can also use the cloud for content
                          delivery, placing their content closer to their
                          end-users to reduce latency. This also adds another
                          layer of business continuity as these customer-facing
                          applications can be dispersed and stored across
                          multiple locations to prevent a single point of
                          failure.

                          capabilities of an internal cloud and datacenter.
                          Machine learning and other analysis tasks can also be
                          moved based on lowest cost and availability.

                          Many customers are moving first-workload applications
                          to the cloud as their entry point. These entry-point
                          applications include Microsoft Active Directory,
                          Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Exchange, and
                          collaboration tools. Customers may also choose to move

                          data protection laws require protections for personal
                          information that are significantly different from
                          regulations in the United States and other regions. In
                          the United States, medical privacy laws such as HIPAA
                          and others create strict requirements on storage and
                          use of medical data. Utilizing a hybrid cloud is a
                          step in the right direction because you can use public
                          cloud providers in specific regions to support the
                          regulations for processing and storage.{" "}

                        <p>
                          To deliver a good experience, enterprises need to be
                          as close to customers as possible, and they need to
                          understand how customers consume applications, as well
                          as what components (payments, ads, videos) are
                          required from outside sources. Using a hybrid cloud,
                          enterprises can set up multiple availability zones
                          under their control, connect with cloud service
                          providers in regional markets, and use edge computing
                          techniques to forge a direct con¬nection to public
                          cloud resources.

                      <p>
                        The first step is for CIOs to connect with the business
                        to establish clear lines of communication and to set
                        common goals. Within the IT organization, CIOs must set
                        policies that identify the need to prepare for hybrid
                        cloud as a priority for overall IT strategies. Then we
                        recommend assessing the company’s applications and IT
                        estate and creating a roadmap to guide the journey to
                        optimal hybrid cloud. This roadmap should compare
                        current and future run costs to create a business case
                        for change; assess application and workload placement
                        and data locality options; recommend application
                        transformation requirements; consider IT policy and
                        operating model factors; and ultimately produce clear,
                        data-based recommendations with a proposed execution
                        plan to enable hybrid IT transformation to happen.
                        Getting there will require transforming and migrating
                        applications, integrating and orchestrating
                        environments, automating and monitoring business
                        services, enabling digital processes, and integrating
                        data and security.{" "}

                          As companies embrace hybrid Cloud, they must address
                          both technology and the human side of change. There
                          are several key actions to take:

                            As the organization start embracing hybrid cloud and
                            take benefits of Serverless, PaaS, IoT and edge
                            computing, so the workforce should become more
                            integrated, multifunctional, flexible and agile.
                            Existing and new IT stuffs must adept cloud
                            technologies, agile methodologies so that they can
                            build, deploy and scale applications across multiple
                            infrastructure environments using Agile and DevOps
                            processes. Most importantly companies need to foster
                            a culture of learning at scale.

                            operations function should adapt to manage both
                            on-premises and cloud-based applications. This new
                            model, called CloudOps, can provide continuous
                            integrated operations in a multi-cloud environment
                            to enable rapid response to events, incidents and
                            requests. Adding DevOps to the mix then utilizes
                            automation, integration and organizational change to
                            enable more frequent enhancements that result in

                            To the extent possible, automate IT support
                            functions. For example, the traditional trouble
                            ticket system can be manually intensive and
                            inefficient. Automation can improve service and free

                            learning and AI to take log data from cloud-based
                            systems and automatically take actions to resolve or
                            even prevent incidents. The idea is to learn once,
                            fix with code and share learnings to improve code
                            over time and scale knowledge.

                            Business units are often acquiring the cloud
                            services they need because IT moves too slowly. At
                            some point, those services must be integrated back
                            into the traditional IT environment for operational
                            and security reasons through a services governance
                            model that encompasses hybrid IT elements. In
                            addition, it’s important for CIOs to have a handle
                            on what the enterprise is spending on IT services.
                            The only way to accomplish this is to adopt hybrid
                            IT and demonstrate to business units that IT can
                            support the pace and scale that the business
